# Workshop in Python

## Set up environment
Open a anaconda terminal and `cd` to a folder to where you want to clone the repository. 
Write:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/magnussommarsjo/python_workshop.git
```
`cd` into the `sample_code` folder and run 
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate python_workshop
conda develop C:\{your_directory}\sample_code\exercises
```

Now you should have an environment you can use in your IDE of choice.
